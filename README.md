# Hi! I'm Robert.

I believe there ought to be a constitutional amendment outlawing Friday releases and crunch time. I believe in the sweet spot, automation, opening your presents Christmas morning rather than Christmas Eve and I believe in light speed database updates that last milliseconds.

I also believe you can talk smack to me on Twitter [@robertreeves](https://twitter.com/robertreeves).
